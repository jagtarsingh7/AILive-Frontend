> The current datepicker is not fully working, we're not using in our current app but we'll in the future
> I'd suggest not trying to go on that route of fixing it but to use the native date picker if needed
>
> ```ts
> import { Input } from '@canvass/components';
>
> <Input type="date" /> // native date picker
> <Input type="datetime-local" /> // native date picker with time
> ```
